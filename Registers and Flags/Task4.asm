			
			_start, _loop, and _end are labels.

	_start is the entry point of the program.

	_loop is a label used to mark the start of a loop.

	_end is a label marking the end of the program.

	Labels provide a way to organize and structure your code, making it easier to read and 	understand, and they enable control flow instructions like jumps or conditional branches 	to specific parts of the code.

	Question:1 
		if we don't use labels in our assembly code is our program execute?

	Answer:
	1.
	Entry Point: In most cases, a label named _start or similar denotes the entry point of 			the program. Without this label, the assembler might not know where the program starts 			its execution.
	2.
	Control Flow: Labels are essential for defining branches, loops, and jumps within the 			code. Without them, it becomes difficult to specify where the program should go next or 			where to branch based on certain conditions.
	3.
`	Readability and Maintenance: Labels improve code readability and organization. Without 		them, the code might appear as a continuous sequence of instructions without clear 			sections or identifiable segments.
	4.
	Navigating Code: Labels provide reference points to various parts of the code. Without 		labels, it becomes challenging to understand or find specific sections of the code.
	5.
	Debugging: Debugging becomes complex without labels as it's harder to pinpoint specific 		sections where issues might arise.
	
	CONCLUSION:'

	While it's technically possible to write assembly code without labels, especially for 			very small and straightforward programs, using labels significantly improves code 			structure, readability, and maintainability. Labels are crucial for guiding program 			execution, defining logical segments, and providing reference points within the code.
